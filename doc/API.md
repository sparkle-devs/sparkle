# Sparkle API
This file will describe the interface you have with addons, both the `api` variable, the `Mod` object, and `Mod` events.

## Addons structure
A typical addon file is a simple "return" statement, returing a class extending Mod containing metadata about the addon and its code. Here is an example:
```js
return class extends Mod {
    // Metadata
    ID = "example-addon"; // the id of the addon
    NAME = "Example Addon"; // human-readable name
    DESCRIPTION = "An example addon for Sparkle."; // description
    VERSION = "1.0"; // version
    AUTHOR = "Your Name"; // author
    DEPENDS = []; // dependencies (addon ids, useful for libraries)
    DO_MENU = true; // whether to add a menu item

    // Main function - gets ran when the addon is loaded
    main() {
        // ...
    }

    // Cleanup function - get ran when the addon is "deleted"
    cleanupFunc() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

Read the comments contained in the example for what each object property does. Your addon is loaded by calling the `main` function. Using `this.api`, you can do multiple actions, described below:

## API
This section describes the variables/functions that can be invoked from `this.api` in `main()`.

### Variables
* `ide` - The `IDE_Morph` (check Snap!'s `gui.js` for more infomation) Snap! is using. This is the Snap! interface.
* `world` - The `WorldMorph` (check Snap!'s `morphic.js` for more infomation) Snap! uses. This is the thing that contains the IDE.

### Functions
* `showMsg` - Show a basic message to the user.
* `addApi` - Add a "extra API" to the Sparkle API. This is useful for libraries. This is added to all addons' `api` objects.
* `inform` - Inform the user of something, with a title.
* `wrapFunction` - Lets you add extra code that runs after a function. Sparkle automatically discards each wrap when deleting an addon!
* `registerMenuHook` - Attach a menu hook. First item is the name of the menu to hook, and the second is a function which takes in a MenuMorph and modifies it. Here are the menu names:
    * `projectMenu` - Menu from file button
    * `settingsMenu` - Menu from settings button
    * `cloudMenu` - Menu from cloud button
    * `scriptsMenu` - Menu when you right-click on a scripting area
    * `snapMenu` - Menu when you click the Snap! logo

## `this` in `main`
The object stored in `this` is a `Mod` object (see `index.js`), because you of course inherited from it. This object supports events using EventTarget. You can `addEventListener` and such, just like DOM elements. The section following contains those events you can attach to.

### Events
* `projectCreating` - Triggered whenever the current project is about to be replaced with a new one. You can cancel this action by calling "preventDefault" on it.
* `projectCreated` - Triggered after a project is created, if it was not cancelled by another event
* `categoryCreating` - Triggered whenever a new category is about to be created. You can cancel this action by calling "preventDefault" on it. The 'detail' property of the event object contains the `name` and `color` (Color) of the category.
* `categoryCreated` - Triggered after a category is created, if it was not cancelled by another event. 'detail' is the same as categoryCreating.

## "Snap" detection
One very interesting feature in Sparkle is its cross-modness. This means, that not only can you run Sparkle and make addons for Snap!, you can also use it on other Snap! mods!

The current term for a Snap! mod (including Snap! itself) is simply a "Snap".

There are functions that allow you to require, suggest OR disallow a specfic Snap!. For example, if you are making an addon for [Split](https://www.github.com/e016/split-mod) that should only be supported on Split, you can call `requireSnaps`. Here are the functions you can use (all of these can take multiple params, for each snap):

* `requireSnaps`: Require either one of a set of snaps to run your addon
* `suggestSnaps`: Suggest a list of snaps that would work perfectly with your addon
* `disallowSnaps`: Disallow a list of snaps that your addon doesn't support. (e.g. better-flat-design, which won't work with Split as Split already has good flat design built-in)
